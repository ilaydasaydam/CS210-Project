#My README

#Hello, I am İlayda Saydam, Junior Industrial Engineering&Economics student in Sabancı University. I am passionate about traveling, fashion and social media management. Respecting my passions, I decided to start a small-business in Shopier where I sell jewelry that is used for everyone. My main complain about the jewelry was how fast they became useless when they are worn so much, so my main focus was finding products that last longer with feasible prices. 

In  my fall junior semester, I took CS210, Data Science and for my term project I decided to combine my small-business and data sciences that I learnt. So firstly, I imported the Excel file as a CSV file to Python and started to analyze it using different techniques of data science. 

The detailed explanation of how I used my data and what outcomes I found was explained in the CS210 Project Report file, and the code with respect to this project is in CS210 Project Code.

I wish it was also useful for you to understand how hard working a small company is!
