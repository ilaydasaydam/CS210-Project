#My README

#Hello, I am İlayda Saydam, Junior Industrial Engineering&Economics student in Sabancı University. I am passionate of travilling, fashin and social media managment. Respect to my passions, I deciede to emerge a small-business in Shopier which I sell jewerly that is used for everyone. My main complain abput the jewerlies was how fast they became useless when they are worn so much, so my main focus was found products that are last longer with feasible prices. 

In  my fall junior semester, I took class of CS210, Data Sceienes and for my temr project I decided to combine my small-business and data scienes that I learnt. So firstly, I imported the Excel file as CSV file to Pyton and started to analyse it using different techniques of data scienes. 

The detailed explanetion of how I used my data and what outcomes did i found was explained in the CS210 Project Report file, and the code respect to this project are in CS210 Project Code.

I wish it was also usefull for you to understand how a hard working small company is!
